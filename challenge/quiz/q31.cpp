/*
 This could be interpreted as a variable definition (which was the intention of the programmer in this example), or as a declaration of a function y, returning an object of type Y, taking a function (with no arguments, returning an object of type X) as its argument.

 The compiler is required by the standard to choose the second interpretation, which means that y.f() does not compile (since y is now a function, not an object of type Y).
